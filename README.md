# finalProjectReport 
This read me is meant to serve as a mini code book of sorts to help guide the viewer in understanding and locating key information throughout the analysis. In the repository, the research proposal of the original study is named ‘Research Paper_1.pdf’ and can be found in the ‘docs’ folder. The analysis report is named ‘Final_Project_Report.docx’ and can also be found in the ‘docs’ folder.
The original dataset being examined is named “dataset_212.csv”. This file can be found in the data folder. In order to preserve the information from the original dataset, I created a copy called “CopyOfdataset_212.csv,” which can also be found in the “data” folder of the repository. 
All changes made to the data were stored in variables so that neither the original nor copied data sets were altered. For example, ‘df_copy’ and its variations, are variables that were created to read in the copy of the dataset and make data alterations. The variable ‘df_copy_recode’ and its variations, are used to house the recoding of specific variables within the dataset. For an in-depth description of all variables, please see the main_program rmd file, which is in the main repository page. One can also refer to the Final_Project_Report.docx in the docs folder for further descriptions.
All data visualizations can be found in the data visualizations folder.
